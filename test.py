#Basic math
print (a + b) #can also be add(a, b)
print (a - c) #can also be sub(a, b)
print (d * b) #can also be mul(a, b)
print (a / e) #can also be div(a, b),  only with furure truediv(a, b)
print (a // b) #can also be floordiv(a, b)
print (d ** e) #can also be pow(a, b)
print (d ^ b) #can also be xor(a, b) (compairs bits)
print (a % b) #can also be mod(a, b)    
print (a & b) #can also be and_(a, b)
print (a is b) #can also be is_(a, b)
